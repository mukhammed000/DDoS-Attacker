DDoS-Attacker
DDoS-Attacker is a robust load-testing tool that helps developers and DevOps engineers assess the strength and reliability of their APIs. By simulating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, it allows users to test how well their APIs handle high volumes of requests. This project is ideal for identifying bottlenecks, optimizing server performance, and ensuring API resilience under stress.

Features
API Strength Testing: Sends a configurable number of requests to an endpoint to evaluate its response to high traffic.
Customizable Parameters: Set the number of requests, delay between requests, and target URL for detailed control over the test.
Real-Time Results: Shows response times and the overall success rate, helping identify weaknesses.
Simple Setup: Easy to install and run with minimal setup.
How It Works
The DDoS-Attacker tool enables users to enter specific parameters, such as:

URL: The endpoint to be tested.
Number of Requests: The number of requests to simulate the traffic.
Delay: Optional delay between requests to mimic more realistic traffic patterns.
Once these parameters are provided, DDoS-Attacker begins sending requests and monitors the API’s behavior under pressure. The tool then summarizes the API’s resilience based on response times and error rates, providing insights into how well the API can withstand potential DDoS attacks.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Go: Make sure you have Go installed. You can download it here.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DDoS-Attacker.git
cd DDoS-Attacker
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
Generate the Swagger documentation (optional for developers):

bash
Copy code
swag init
Usage
Run the program with the following command:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
Endpoint: By default, Swagger UI will be available at http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html where you can input parameters and view results.
Parameters: Use the Swagger UI or directly set the required parameters (URL, NumRequests, and Delay) to test your API.
Example
Access Swagger UI at http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html.
Enter:
URL: The target endpoint.
NumRequests: Set the volume (e.g., 1000 requests).
Delay (optional): Specify any delay between requests in milliseconds.
Run the test to see a detailed report of response times, errors, and performance.
Sample Output:
yaml
Copy code
Load Test Result:
  URL: https://example.com/api
  Requests Sent: 1000
  Average Response Time: 120ms
  Error Rate: 0.5%
  Status: API is resilient under stress
